I have changed the way that the threading works, it is now in keeping with the recomendations by the msdn

Feel free to make changes to this code it was a good exercise for me to get back into programming with C#

I have commented ever line so hopefully it is easy to follow but I did not go into extreme detail, I would be greatful if someone 
gave some more detailed comments especially in regards to how the asynchronus threading works in the Form1.Designer.cs part of the code

I'm not sure if I'll add to this code but if I do I will update this readme.
